## Custom set

Create a custom set type using Typescript â€“ a data structure that meets the mathematical definition
of set - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)
It should be a generic Typescript class e.g. `MySet<T>.` The internal implementation details are up to
you to decide.
Pay attention to its performance and implement relevant functions or operators (e.g. add, remove,
intersection, union, difference etc.) - choose as many as you like from the link above. The quality of
your code is more important than the extent of functionalities.
Prepare code that demonstrates/tests implemented features.
